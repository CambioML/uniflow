Meetings cost\\nthem more.\\nThere are two t ypes of schedule, which I'll call the manager's\\nschedule and the mak er's schedule. The manager's schedule is for\\nbosses. It's embodied in the tr aditional appointment book, with\\neach da y cut into one hour interv als. Y ou can block off sev eral\\nhours for a single task if y ou need to , but b y default y ou change\\nwhat y ou're doing ev ery hour .\\nWhen y ou use time that w ay, it's merely a pr actical problem to\\nmeet with someone. Find an open slot in y our schedule, book\\nthem, and y ou're done.\\nMost powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the\\nschedule of command. But there's another w ay of using time\\nthat's common among people who mak e things, lik e progr ammers\\nand writers. They gener ally prefer to use time in units of half a\\nday at least. Y ou can't write or progr am well in units of an hour .\\nThat's barely enough time to get started.\\nWhen y ou're oper ating on the mak er's schedule, meetings are a\\ndisaster . A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, b y\\nbreaking it into two pieces each too small to do an ything hard in.\\nPlus y ou ha ve to remember to go to the meeting. That's no\\nproblem for someone on the manager's schedule. There's alw ays\\nsomething coming on the next hour; the only question is what.\\nBut when someone on the mak er's schedule has a meeting, they\\nhave to think about it.\\nFor someone on the mak er's schedule, ha ving a meeting is lik e\\nthrowing an ex ception. It doesn't merely cause y ou to switch\\nfrom one task to another; it changes the mode in which y ou\\nwork.\\nI find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole da y. A meeting\\ncommonly blows at least half a da y, by breaking up a morning or\\nafternoon. But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect. If\\nI know the afternoon is going to be brok en up , I'm slightly less\\nlikely to start something ambitious in the morning. I know this\\nmay sound o versensitiv e, but if y ou're a mak er, think of y our own\\ncase. Don't y our spirits rise at the thought of ha ving an entire da y\\nfree to work, with no appointments at all? W ell, that means y our\\nspirits are correspondingly depressed when y ou don't. And\\nambitious projects are b y definition close to the limits of y our   \n",
